# Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the existing PageRank algorithm implemented in the provided Python script (pagerank.py). PageRank is a fundamental algorithm used to rank web pages based on their link structure, and this project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm, ensuring that the most relevant pages are ranked higher.

Files in the Repository
pagerank.py: Contains the main code for executing the PageRank algorithm.
CodeOutput: Stores the output for all tasks and parts of the project, detailing the PageRank results and filtering processes.
lawfareblog.csv.gz and small.csv.gz: These are the datasets used for the project. Each file represents a web graph in CSV format.

Project Goals
The primary objectives of the project include:
Fixing the PageRank calculation to ensure that the most important web pages are ranked correctly.
Implementing the power method to compute the PageRank vector for the web graph.
Filtering non-relevant pages using various methods, such as adjusting in-link ratios, to focus the results on relevant articles.
Exploring personalization vectors to tailor the PageRank results to specific search queries.
